            <p><strong>Welcome to my first webpage!</strong> I am currently in the UCLA Web Development Coding Bootcamp and am so excited to be on this journey. It has been a wirlwind of a first two weeks, and they were right.... Already I look back at this first webpage and realized how far I've come, and just how much I learned.
            </p> 
            <p>This website was a struggle to start but an ease and joy to finish. Through my experience I have learned how much I love the process of coding, and that most solutions are, in hindsight, simple "fixes":
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do I have a closing <strong> /div > </strong>?</li>
                <li>Is there an extra comma somewhere?</li>
                <li>Are the proper style.css and logic.js scripts linked?</li>
                <li>Do I have a "." for classes and "#" fir Ids on my CSS sheet?</li>
                <em>...And so many more!</em>
            </ul>    
            </p>     
            <p><strong>But this week I learned about Bootstrap!</strong> Bootstrap is an incredible tool, however, I love that I learned about the fundamentals first without knowing about Bootstrap; without having struggled through this first webpage, I would not only <em>not</em> appreciate the power of Bootstrap, but I wouldn't understand how a page works together (!) or any of the more advanced concepts we're starting to learn about on as deep a level.
